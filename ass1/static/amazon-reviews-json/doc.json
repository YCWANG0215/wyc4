This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie.

The plump, flightless animals were slow breeders with a single offspring per mating season and no natural enemies. Add ravenous creatures (Homo sapiens included) into their safe mircosphere and diaster was assured.Pinto-Correia traces the few captive dodos in Euorpe and the fates of their remains.

(FYI: For reviewers that complain about gum bleaching, this is the answer to your woes because the trays will fit your teeth perfectly and not get bleach goo on your gums) I was very excited that Aquafresh introduced these trays because after I bleach, I can rinse out the trays and put in the fluoride gel for as long as I can stand.

But there's still enough stuff in the music that brings individuality to it. My favourite tracks are \"Main Titles\", \"Costume Montage\", \"Parade Attack\" and \"Farewell\".

The construction also involves elastic on the edge between the \"wing\" and the bra strap which created an obvious puckering of the fabric, even when being worn. The puckering showed through to my shirt. I probably could have ignored that unattrative effect if I hadn't had the sanding sensation.

    {"score":"3","city":"Annapolis","title":"Worth it for the remix","review":"The remix of Hey Jupiter that is featured on this EP is definently worth the price of the CD in and of itself. I think it's an amazing and moving version of the song, and I prefer it over the album version. As for the other tracks, I don't care for the Professional Widow live track, but it's an interesting and sort of creepy experience. \"Sugar\" is a good Tori track, also worth owning - and she talks in the beginning, which I always like. :) I think any Tori fan should definently own this CD, if only for the mix of \"Hey Jupiter\"."},

    {"score":"4","city":"Fort Lauderdale","title":"A good book overall","review":"This book is essential to someone who needs pictures (I do not). Should this be the case, and if you plan on rebuilding one of these transmissions, I strongly suggest you use this AND an ATSG manual....and you cannot go wrong. The ATSG manuals is the best, the ONLY, and it's the real bible....but there are no pictures. Once you've done one, you don't need pics, but if you do....the Haynes is the one to buy, and they are cheap! If you have both, you should be OK. I strongly recommend this manual for the price, it would be worth it for twice the money. I have no real use for it, but I wanted to see one for myself and I am quite impressed! If you are not a seasoned transmission guy, buy this, you won't regret it. I am not a fan of the Haynes manuals, but they did a nice job on this particular one and you certainly can't beat the price!"},

    {"score":"2","city":"Mansfield","title":"Wahl Professional 8685 Peanut Classic Clipper/trimmer","review":"I bought this hair clipper to replace my old one, which just wore out from use. My old \"Peanut\" clipper came with a very nice limber electrical cord and it was easy to use and stored away nicely. The new one came with a very large and very, very stiff cord and is full of kinks which I cannot remove. This makes the clipper awkward to use and impossible to store. I don't recommend buying this clipper, unless you're into frustration!"},

    {"score":"5","city":"Kenmore","title":"The American Prophecies","review":"American Prophecies is a GREAT book!!! I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. Mike Evans offered so much insight and understanding into what was behind all the terrorism events that have been going on in Israel and in the United States. Every page was packed full of helpful information, historical information that I was not aware of. Also, the book provided a lot of help in what we can do as Christians, both individually and as a nation, in these last days before the second return of Christ. This book really opened my eyes and explained a lot of things that were going on. I highly recommend the book!"},
    {"score":"2","city":"Wausau","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. It was so boring and didn't say anything to add to this very important topic. The chapters just had statisics with just a few references to behavior or solutions. Please don't waste your money on this one. The best one so far was the one written by Robert Hare."},
    {"score":"3","city":"Wausau","title":"Flawed Statistics","review":"I found \"Practical Speculation\" lacking. The first two chapters were interesting, but the analysis of data in subsequent chapters were flawed, in my opinion.Niederhoffer cites scatter plots as demonstrating correlation/predictibility of various aspects of the market. I looked at many graphs and didn't see much that showed statistical correlation. The correlation coefficients (R-squared values) were all very low.The trading ideas were interesting, but the analysis behind them was misleading. You need strategies with better correlations to hurdle transaction costs, and then, maybe, you can make some money."},

I immedaitly bought the game and was this game ever worth it!! The new cources are perfectly detailed, and also longer, giving you the chance for a comeback late in the race!

I'm about as uncoordinated as they come, so I'm sure some of it is me; however, I found that I simply could not contort myself into the positions necessary. Cross this foot over that foot, then kick yourself in the rear. No thanks. I nearly fell over several times just trying."},

You basically have to bend the plug so it won't fall out due to gravity. FAIL!!!"},

If you're thinking of buying this just for fun (and not for the need of any game) I suggest you to give up. Not worth the money."},

Volume 1 is GREAT! My boyfriend and I sit and laugh at the incredible, creative, off-the-wall humor. Often we have to replay a sentence or two because one of us missed something too funny to let pass. With the famous \"pinky, are you thinking what i'm thinking?\" lines and their quirky personalities, pinky and brain are sure to delight even new viewers. for more insight into the nuances of the show, it is helpful to read the wikip. piece. i am impatiently awaiting volume 2...."},
    {"score":"2","city":"Parma","title":"This vacuum sucks!","review":"I bought two of these - a small one and a large like this one pictured here. Both are a pain in the a**. The one pictured here had to be sent back about five times and now sits in my garage. The second smaller is now starting to have problems with the motor. It is shooting out sparks after having for about 2 1/2 years.The toggle switches get loose and I tired to take the smaller one apart but they make it so you can't do it. So I am waiting till that one burns itself up and it will go to scrap. Very disappointed. I have an old eureka mighty might that still works after falling down the stairs many times and it is over ten years old. I bought those two vacuums because one I thought they would last forever and two because they were made in USA. Thank God for the internet and reviews from everyone because they will help with next purchase."},

I loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but I'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time. I had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute! in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but I did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64. brutal. I had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap. never buy this. never."}
